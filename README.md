# fauna-test


## Next Steps
 * Figure out if there's a way to resolve references on the Fauna DB side instead of the client side, to reduce the number of queries made
 * Enhance models to match retrieval of data (e.g. add possibility that a field is actually a reference) or enhance retrieval to resolve *all* references and match models
